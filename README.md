# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
This project is an Attrition Analysis, and I am pleased to uncover that this organization boasts a remarkably low attrition rate. Here are my key findings:
Low Attrition Rate: The attrition rate stands at 16.12%, which is significantly lower to the retention rate.
Age-Related Trend: Employees aged 28-38 were more likely to leave, indicating that this age group might be experiencing specific challenges or pressures.
Marital-Status Trend: The analysis revealed that more single people left the organization, suggesting that work-life balance or personal circumstances might be influencing their decisions.
Tenure and Career Progression Trend: Employees tend to stay with the organization for an average of 5 years, indicating a strong sense of loyalty and commitment.
Business Travel: Interestingly, the analysis showed that business travel did not have a significant impact on attrition rates, suggesting that the organization's travel policies and support structures are effective.
These findings suggest that the organization is doing something right in terms of employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. However, there's always room for improvement!
By continuing to analyze and understand the factors influencing employee turnover, they can refine their strategies to foster an even more positive and supportive work environment.
